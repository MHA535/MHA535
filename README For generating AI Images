Instagram is dead.

In the next 3 - 5 years, every single image in social media will be generated by AI.

And here is the kicker: It will be impossible to tell fake from reality.


I wrote a few lines of Python code to show you how screwed we are:

You need two things if you want to do the same:

1. Google Colab.
2. An API_KEY from @leap_api to fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model.

All of this is free, so go here and grab your API KEY: https://www.tryleap.ai/.

Don't worry; I'm sharing my code at the end of this thread.

How hard could it be to generate unlimited photos of anyone?

It took me 30 minutes to make an Obama generator.

Fewer than 100 lines that you can use to generate hyperrealistic photos of you, your neighbor, or anyone you desire.

And you can do this at scale!

I uploaded two images from my code to fine-tune a model.

Less than 1 minute later, I had a custom model I could use to generate as many images of Obama as I wanted.

The more images you use, the better the model will be.

The results are scary.

My prompt: "A photo wearing a tall black hat and sunglasses."

Wow!

Here is a link to the entire code base: https://lnkd.in/eRS6XBCi.

Remember:

1. Get an API KEY from https://www.tryleap.ai/.
2. Use your own photos

Now, tell me how long it will be before Instagram is gone.
